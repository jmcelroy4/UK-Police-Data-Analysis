These codes compile and analyse (at a basic level) the data from UK Police in three areas in the past 3-4 years.

The areas covered are: Metropolitan, West Midlands, North Yorkshire.

The code is created for streamlined access and organisation. Dataframes for month, year and area are created as instance variables of an object where macrodetails of each
object can be stored as further instance variables.

The data used in this project was taken from https://data.police.uk/data/ in csv format. There were two types of csv downloaded: Stop & Search and Street Crime.
